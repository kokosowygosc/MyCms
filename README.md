# MyCms
Little CMS which contains features of managing: blog, comments, static pages, little gallery and shop. 

The whole thing is made thanks to beautiful framework Bootstrap (which responds for front end) and CodeIgniter (backend).
You can see it working here: http://krokiety.hol.es/

Instalation:
I have put there database localhost.sql which can be installed on your hosting. 
Then all you need to do is few modification in application/config to work anywhere. (database name, user name etc).
Call me if you need help:)
