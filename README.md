# MyCms
Little CMS which contains features of managing: blog, comments, static pages and shop. 

The whole thing is made thanks to beautiful framework Bootstrap (which responds for front end) and CodeIgniter (backend).
You can see it working there: http://krokiety.hol.es/

I also have put there database localhost.sql which need only few modification in config to work anywhere.
